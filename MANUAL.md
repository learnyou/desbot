# Desbot usage manual

## Syntax

If you are posting in a channel, you must prefix every command with a
tilde: `~`. If you are posting in a private message, you may omit the
tilde.

To direct a message at someone, use one of the following syntax things:

    person: ~command
    person, ~command

Note that, for the time being, any preceding nick in a private message
is ignored.

## Top-level commands, in alphabetical order
