# icebot

This is an IRC bot for the [`#snowdrift` channel on FreeNode][1].

## Installation

I have tested this on Arch Linux with stack 0.0.3

1.  Install [stack][2] and [git][3].
2.  Run these commands in a terminal:

        git clone git://github.com/pharpend/icebot.git
        cd icebot
        stack install

I would add usage, but currently it does nothing, so there is no usage.
